The shadow party stats are specified within the RAM area of $7E:1140-127F. 
These hold the stat data for characters 
that have left your party but will rejoin later. The data areas for each 
character are:

1140-117F   Kain
1180-11BF   Tellah/FuSoYa (and Cid)
11C0-11FF   Rosa
1200-123F   Yang
1240-127F   Rydia

Some code that is being executed knows when and for whom to save the data, 
but I don't know the location of it. 
Re-adding a character outside these five will add the character with their 
original stats.

Though equipment information is within these stats, when one of these five 
characters is re-added, their new equipment 
is determined by the initial equipment information (7AD00-7AD91). The one 
exception to this is Tellah when he receives 
all his spells on Mt. Ordeals. His initial equipment specification for that 
instance of his character is empty, but 
he maintains the same equipment that his last character instance had. I'm not 
sure how this works, exactly.

Magic lists are also separate from these stats and are continuous throughout 
the game. For example, if you remove older 
Rydia from your party and add child Rydia, she'll maintain the same magic 
lists even though her stats and equipment 
match her child instance.

Rydia, Kain, Rosa, and Yang all have their equipment specified in the initial 
equipment bytes. Tellah does, too -- he 
comes back with slightly different equipment the second time: the first time 
he is equipped with a Staff and a Leather 
Robe, the second time he is equipped with a Staff, a Gaea Robe, and an 
IronRing. All of these work correctly with 
their initial equipment specification.

The third instance of Tellah (after Mt. Ordeals) is the one with no specified 
equipment, but he keeps the same equipment 
he had in the second instance.

-the information I've found says that Cid's stats are loaded into the second 
shadow data slot as well. This means that, 
at some point in development, he was intended to rejoin your party.

There's two different sets of bytes:

1. The first is the table for loading characters stats when a character joins 
your party. This is from 0689A-068AE (FF2us ROM 
with header). There is 1 byte per character ID. Values of 00-0F mean to load 
the initial stats for the characters 
(referencing the table at 7AB00), and values of 80-84 mean to load the shadow 
data stats.

2. The second table is for storing character stats in the shadow data slots 
when a character leaves your party. This is 
from 0691D-06930, again with 1 byte per character ID. Values of 00-04 mean to 
store the data in that shadow slot, and a 
value of 80 means don't store.

So, here's how the data lines up with the character IDs:
ID  Character Instance    Load  Store
--  ------------------    ----  -----
01  Cecil (Dark Knight)    00    80
02  Kain                   01    00
03  Rydia (child)          02    04
04  Tellah                 03    01
05  Edward                 04    80
06  Rosa                   05    02
07  Yang                   06    03
08  Palom                  07    80
09  Porom                  08    80
0A  Tellah (second time)   81    01
0B  Cecil (Paladin)        09    80
0C  Tellah (all spells)    81    80
0D  Yang (second time)     83    80
0E  Cid                    0A    01
0F  Kain (second time)     80    00
10  Rosa (second time)     82    80
11  Rydia (older)          84    80
12  Edge                   0B    80
13  FuSoYa                 0C    01
14  Kain (third time)      80    80
15  Golbez                 0D    

There are five shadow data slots of 64 bytes each. These store the same stat
