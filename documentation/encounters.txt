There are 511 possible monster formations, each composed of 8 bytes, 
located in a table at 70200 (previously discussed here: 
http://slickproductions.org/forum/index.php?topic=1713.300) 
[see formations.txt]

There are 96 sets of monster formations that can be assigned to any 
given location. Each set consists of eight of the possible monster 
formations (represented by one byte each, and whether this byte 
represents one of the first 255 or the latter 255 formations is 
determined by whether the location it's set to is in the Overworld or 
Underworld/Moon). The probability of each formation within a set is 
even. The table for these sets begins at 74996.

Which monster formation set is used by each location is determined by a
table beginning at 74742.

According to Phoenix:
   74742-74781   For the Overworld (1 byte per 32x32 tile region)
   74782-74791   For the Underground (1 byte per 32x32 tile region)
   74792-74795   For the Moon (1 byte per 32x32 tile region)
   74796-74995   For Locations (1 byte per location)
