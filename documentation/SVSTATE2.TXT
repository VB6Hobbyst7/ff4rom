I. Introduction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

	My alias is PKT_Paladin, but that is not my name.  For this FAQ you
don't need to know my real name =).  Please don't steal anything from this
FAQ for your site or for your own FAQ unless you provide some sort of credit.
I wrote everything in this FAQ.  These offsets are specifically for the emulator
ZSNES and the game these offsets for is Final Fantasy 2 for SNES (the one that
was released in America).

II. Revision History
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

v.90		: I elaborated on all of the sections to warn about
		  certain offsets and to inform of the maximum for each
		  offset, etc.
v.85		: A big thanks goes out to Excalibur from rpgclassics!  I
		  found his hacking guide and compared it with mine to
		  fix a few problems I was having and now this FAQ is
		  better than ever, having corrections in all areas.
v.80		: This is the first version made and it contains information
		  mostly about hacking the stats and equipment for the
		  characters in your party.  When I find new important
		  offsets they will be added.

III. How to Hack Save States
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
	Download Hex Workshop from download.com.  Install it, run it, and 
open up the save state file.  On the left you will see addresses on the 
left and 16 columns on the right.  There are actually 16 bytes each in
groups of two.  Observe:

    0 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
   10 0000 0000 0000 00FF 0000 0000 0000 0000

	The location of the byte FF is actually 17.  In hex, as opposed to
the regular number system we are used to that goes from 0-10, the numbers
go from 0-F (0-10 and then A,B,C,D,E,F).  That means FF is the highest value
and 00 is the lowest (FF is 255 in decimal and 00 is 0).  Find the location
that I have listed in the savestate editting section and modify the bytes
to as high or as low as you desire.  When you are done, save it on the
hexidecimal editor and load it in the emulator and you should be done.

XII. Credits
~~~~~~~~~~~~
Squaresoft		- They made the game.  They deserve all of
			  the credit.
Nintendo		- As much as I hate the butchering they did
			  to the original, amazing story line, they
			  licensed the game and made the Super NES.
Excalibur		- This guy is a staff member at RPGClassics.
			  After just about finishing this guide I found
			  out that he had written a lot of information
			  on the same things so I compared our work
			  and fixed a lot of bugs I had on here.  Much
			  thanks goes out to him!
