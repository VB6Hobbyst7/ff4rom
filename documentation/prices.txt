I was editing an inn price for my hack this evening, and I noticed that my changes definitely did not fit the formula suggested by Yousei's FF4 data for event code DCxx (Inn: costing 50 * 2^xx). I started getting some wacky numbers after a value of 08, so I jotted them down, converted them to hex, reversed the bytes, and did a search for that data. It turns out that there's actually a GP cost table located from 06C83-06C94 (in a FF2us headered ROM). There's only 9 entries; after that is ASM code, which is why the values are so weird. Here's an example of the first 16:

##	GP Value
--	--------
00	50
01	100
02	200
03	400
04	500
05	600
06	700
07	300
08	1200
09	12453
0A	63629
0B	42248
0C	36145
0D	2297
0E	12965
0F	64141


I have a list of all possible values for xx, if anyone wants it. 9 entries is actually fine, but in case someone wants to go crazy with Inns...
