The Pinkpuff aka Flan Princess seems to have relocated in the Lunar 
Subterrain. Its normal "breeding ground" is that 
little side cave on floor B5. However, I don't think that monster group 
exists there... instead.. I've actually encoutered 
it in a different location... In the area where you have three openings along 
a row.. one is a save point, the other is 
the Holy Spear area, and the other is the dual Ribbon area. I've found the 
Pinkpuff in the dual Ribbon area...

You're absolutely correct, JCE and I never found this data but Zyrthofar has 
it in the new version of his editor. 
The Flan Princesses are now in the Ribbon room instead of the "P" room. 
They're also slightly more common, they now occupy 
the second to rarest slot in addition to the rarest.

You know, those rooms are where the White/Holy Robe and Minerva Robes are... 
which might actually make "some" sense in 
terms of enemy placement (pretty much the "Flan Princesses" guard the women's 
ultimate equipment)...

Not all monsters have all of these fields, but up until the Attack sequence 
they are all the same data.

Well there are three groups of the drop rate.  Each 64 bytes $40 adds a 25% 
extra chance to drop the items.  Unless all 
four possible items are the same in which case the monster will always drop 
said item regardless.  *see "Tower" Key
