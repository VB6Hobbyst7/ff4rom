A81A2-A81CB   Magic List # to Menu Item Link (3 bytes per character: top list, mid list, bottom list)

The top list name defaults to "White", the middle to "Black", and the bottom to "Call". (I don't know where the 
information is that changes Edge's to "Ninja".) So, for example, Dark Knight Cecil's 3 bytes are FF FF FF, 
since he doesn't use magic. If you wanted to map magic list 01 to Black magic for Cecil, you would change his list 
to FF 01 FF.

9FFDD-A000C   Magic List # to Battle Command/Learning Link
A81A2-A81CB   Magic List # to Menu Item Link

They both follow the same format (top list, mid list, bottom list).
