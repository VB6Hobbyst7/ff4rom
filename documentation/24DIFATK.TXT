There are 11 attack sequences that are changed between FF4j and FF2us. I have the hex data if 
anyone is interested, but I think it just clutters up the explanation, so ask me if you want to see it. There are 4
normal sequence changes and 7 lunar sequence changes. Here they are:

Normal:
1. Sequence 71: This is the change documented by Deathlike2 in this thread.
2. Sequence AA: The first instance of the Dark Elf says "ME ATTACK YOU!" (brilliant translation work, in my estimation) 
while performing his fire/lit/ice attack. In FF4j, this is executed with an F1 byte. In FF2us, it's executed with an F2 byte.
Not sure what the difference is, but it's there.
3. Sequence E5: During the Asura battle, her Armor casting in FF4j is changed to a Cure4 casting in FF2us.
4. Sequence F1: During the Elements battle in FF4j, Valvalis performs an attack, casts Ray, attacks twice more, 
then casts Storm. In FF2us, she attacks, casts Ray, attacks, casts Ray, attacks, then casts Storm.

Lunar:
5. Sequence 30: PaleDim's reflex sequence in FF4j is to attack 5 times in a row and then cast Storm. In FF2us he 
just attacks 5 times.
6. Sequence 4C: Zeromus' attack sequence has four small changes. During this sequence, he resets his magic 
power four times. In FF4j, these values are 0x27, 0x27, 0x31, and 0x27. This is changed to 0x1F, 0x20, 0x24, and 0x20 in FF2us.
7. Sequence 4D: Zeromus' reflex sequence also resets his magic power. In FF4j it uses the value of 0x15, in FF2us it's 0x0E.
8. Sequence 4E: Same sequence as #7.
9. Sequence 55: Similar to #6. Values of 0x27, 0x15, and 0x27 are changed to 0x1F, 0x0E, and 0x20.
10. Sequence 58: Similar to #6. Value of 0x28 is changed to 0x24.
11. Sequence 59: I'm pretty sure this isn't used. It's blank in FF4j, and in FF2us it's just 26 (which would cast Virus).
The last value of sequence 58 is 26, so I'm pretty sure it's just a remnant from reducing the sequences at some point.

So, there you have it -- all the changes between FF4j and FF2us. I did this off the hex data, so I might 
have made some mistakes. If any of this isn't reflected in gameplay, let me know.

Battle Scripts
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Part of Yang's battle script is not properly executed...

Battle script 0xA8:
Always
    Battle Message $E
    Target Kain  
    Fight
    (End of Turn)
    Battle Message $F
    Kick
    (End of Turn)
    Battle Message $10
    Target Kain  
    Fight
    (End of Turn)
    Battle Message $11
    Kick
    $F3 to $F8 -  $81
    
 Counter script: 0xA9
 ( $2 $0 $0 $1 )
 If Attacked by Tellah
     Battle Message $12
    Cast Dummy ($AE)
    
 
 The mystery ($2 $0 $0 $1) that is in the editor means "if condition flag 01 is set". Thus, Yang's 
 reaction script is "If condition flag 01 is set and attacked by Paladin Cecil: show battle message 0x12
 and cast 0xAE." So the attack sequence needs to be played out once, condition flag 01 is set, and 
 then as soon as Paladin Cecil attacks after that, Yang says, "Ouch!" and the battle is over.
 
 Battle Script:
 
 While targeting Cecil, display message 0xE and attack him.
 Display message 0xF, then attack with Kick.
 While targeting Cecil, display message 0x10 and attack him.
 Display message 0x11, then attack with Kick.
 Repeat sequence
 
 Counter Script:
 
When Cecil deals physical damage, there is a random chance to execute the following script... 
which is to display message 0x12 and end the battle (by using spell 0xAE).

-this is never executed on a normal run. There's a simple reason. This was intended for Dark Knight Cecil.. 
not Paladin Cecil as the battle script is never normally executed.
