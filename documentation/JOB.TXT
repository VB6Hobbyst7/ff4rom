In addition to the character id byte, each character has another, seperate
byte that determines (at least) the following things:

(1) Their graphic.
(2) Their class name.

Class names are 7 bytes long. The class names are stored from 7A964 to 7A9C5.

id Graphic           Class
-- -------           -----
00 Dark Knight Cecil DKnight
01 Kain              Dragoon
02 young Rydia       Caller
03 Tellah            Sage
04 Edward            Bard
05 Rosa              Wh.Wiz
06 Yang              Karate
07 Palom             Bl.Wiz
08 Porom             Wh.Wiz
09 Paladin Cecil     Paladin
0A Cid               Chief
0B teen Rydia        Caller
0C Edge              Ninja
0D FuSoYa            Lunar
0F Golbez

Golbez doesn't have a 'real' class name, status screen picture, or map screen
animation. Setting a character's sprite/class id byte to 0F causes them to
resemble Golbez in battle only. Setting this byte to 0E results in nothing
useful (a strangely-colored pig...)

If the MSB is set in this byte, it indicates that the character is currently
in the back row. Otherwise, this byte changes little over the course of a
character's existence (the only exception is Rydia, as Dark Knight Cecil is
removed and Paladin Cecil is added; other than sharing a name, the game
considers them totally different).
