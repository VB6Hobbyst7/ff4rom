Initial Mode:
Cagnazzo attacks characters once  - (not useful)
Change into "Water Form"

While in "Water Form":
Display message == "Water is gathering" or whatever
Change weakness to Lightning (while under this state)
Cast Wave on enemy (1/25 of Caster's HP)
Cast Haste on self
Repeat "Water Form" script
If hit by a Lightning magic attack while under "Water Mode", goto Initial Mode
Also Display message == "Lightning neutralizes water" or whatever

At any time, current HP < 700 (not sure if that's an exact number) Always Change To "Shell Mode":
Display message = "Monster hides in shell" or whatever
Set Defense to 3 (while under this state) - Edit: Yes, that's really 3, which is not a significant increase.
Cast Remedy/Heal/Restore (different names for the same spell) - (heals 1/10 of Caster's Max HP)
Repeat script while current HP < 700
Else Change Into "Water Form"

This defense change never occurs... it seems like the FF4A Euro version has this fixed. It may be worth looking into further.
