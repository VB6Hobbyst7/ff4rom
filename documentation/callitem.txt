So far all I can do is change who gets the spell.  The instruction is found at
$1a8b3 - simply change the second byte to the RAM location of the first slot
of the target spell list (for instance, changing from "99 C0 15" to "99 D8 15"
makes Tellah learn the spell in his White list).
A couple of frustrating points about this, though:
1. It still says "Rydia learned..." This is easy enough to fix, though...
2. The game still checks to make sure Rydia is in the party, so I can't make
Tellah learn Imp unless Rydia is there.
3. Seems all four call items execute the same instruction, so if Tellah learns
Imp, he'll also be the one learning Mage, Cockatrice and Bomb.

and, of course,

4. Still haven't figured out how to change which spell is learned.
