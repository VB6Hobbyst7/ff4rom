Weapon = Power

To calculate attack power for Bows+Arrows:

Bow Attack Power/2 + Arrow Attack Power + Strength/4

Bows:

ShortBow = 10
CrossBow = 20
GreatBow = 30
Archer = 40
ElvenBow = 50
Samurai = 60
Artemis = 80

Arrows:

Iron = 5
White = 10
Fire = 15
Ice = 15
Lit = 15
Darkness = 20
Poison = 30
Mute = 35
Charm = 40
Samurai = 50
Medusa = 1
Artemis = 75

Example:
Strength: 99 (empty hand attack power 48)
Artemis Bow attack power: 80
Artemis Arrow attack power: 75

40 + 75 + 24 = 139

The exact amount shown in game.  Nice work.

*edit*And using the attack multiplier that's a 2641 damage median.
