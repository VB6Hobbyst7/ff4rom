Animation
---------
The visual effects for using items in battle is specified from 7D6E0 to 7D7DF 
(ROM with header). There's 1 byte per item, with the value corresponding to 
the spell number (e.g. 0E is Cure1, 1E is Fire2). When I found this I 
originally thought it was the spell cast by the item, but that clashed with 
someone else's information, so I tested it today and the visual effects are 
indeed what I had found earlier. You can make a Fire-casting item look like a 
Cure spell, a healing-type item look like an elemental spell, etc. It's kind 
of fun, actually.
