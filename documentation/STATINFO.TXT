Ok, onto the info. The status description that is displayed in battle is the 
one that has the greatest priority. I believe 
status is stored in 4 bytes (since there are 32 different statuses that can 
possibly occur). The list here starts with 
the status that has the greatest priority and continues with the one with the 
least priority... Unless otherwise 
specified, you cannot inflict a status with a lower priority to a target. For 
instance, Piggy cannot be inflicted on 
a target that has Toad status (barring immunity), because of the status 
priority. However, toad can be inflicted on a 
target that has Piggy status (barring immunity).

Note: This is mostly complete.

Format:
Permanent: When this status is set, it lasts even after the battle is over.
Reversable: If applicable, examples of reversing this status is listed.
Ignores Priority: If applicable, this status can be set, regardless of other 
statuses being set (other than Death or Stone).
In some cases, some statuses can be set outside of battle.
Visual Cue: This is a description of what one can see inside and/or outside 
of battle when the status is set.
Hidden: If applicable, you won't see a status description while the status is 
inflicted on the character when you are 
selecting a Cure/Heal item or spell.
Timer: If applicable, this status has a timer set. It can be influenced by a 
number of factors, usually from some stat 
the game uses to determine how the timer progresses. When the timer expires, 
the status will cause some sort of reaction. 
All statuses except for Sleep can be reset.
Description: Explains details of how this status works on characters and the 
enemy. Miscellaneous details can be found here.

Here we go:

Death/Swoon

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Life1/2, Phoenix Down, Asura (multitargeted Life1).
Ignores Priority: No (it's the highest)
Visual Cue: The character uses the "fallen down" look in battle.
Outside of battle, you will see the status spelled out for the character.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description:  When set, it means HP = 0.
The character is unable to make any commands (ATB bar won't increase).
Enemies die+disappear when this status is afflicted on them.
This can occur via a status attack (Deathbringer or Death spell), reducing 
the target's HP to 0, or Count/Doom reaches 0.

Stone

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Golden Needle
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: When set, a character is effectively frozen in stone and in a 
crouching position.
In the status menu, it is represented by a "rock or stone" and is displayed 
as the leftmost status sprite.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: When set, the ATB bar does not increase and the character is 
effectively frozen for the battle.
Enemies die+disappear when this status is afflicted on them (which is pretty 
much the same as Death status).
This can occur via a status attack (Medusa arrows or Break spell) or caused 
by gradual petrification's timer or attack 
as the final stage.
HP is effectively unchanged for the duration of this status.

Note: Either Death or Stone can be set at one time. Both cannot be issued at 
the same time. Both statuses have the following 
properties:
Physical attacks on a target that has this status are automatically 
retargeted.
Magical attacks on such a target are not retargeted unless it was on a single 
enemy.
Having this status also counts towards the "party death counter/check".
Both statuses removes all other statuses, except Frog, Mini, Piggy, Silence, 
Blind, Float.

Frog/Toad

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Maiden's Kiss, Frog spell
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: When set, the character's sprite becomes a frog. This is viewable 
in the overworld and status menus.
Enemies change into a specific Frog graphics (perhaps shared by the 
TinyToads).
In the status menu, it is represented by a "frog or toad" and is displayed to 
the right of Stone status slot.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This can occur via a status attack (well, there's the spell and 
the Breath attack).
While under this status, the target is unable to use any special attacks, 
most commands, or spells other than Frog or 
Sing's Frog Song.
A target afflicted with this has 1 attack power, 0 defense, 0 evasion (or was 
it a 0 defense multiplier?), and 0 magic 
defense multiplier.

Mini

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Mini spell, Esuna, Mallet
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: When set, the character's sprite becomes tiny. This is viewable 
in the overworld and status menus.
Enemies change into into "miniture" targets (probably shared by the 
TinyMages).
In the status menu, it is represented by a "small doll" and is displayed to 
the right of Frog status.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This can occur via a status attack (the spell and the Breath 
attack).
While under this status, the target is unable to use most commands, but still 
has full access to spells (other than Twin 
magic) and special attacks.
A target afflicted with this has 1 attack power, 0 defense, and 0 evasion (or 
was it a 0 defense multiplier?).

Piggy

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Piggy spell, Diet Food, Esuna
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: When set, the character's sprite becomes a pig. This is viewable 
in the overworld and status menus.
Enemies change into Pigs (not sure where they get this sprite).
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: In the status menu, it is represent by a nice "piggy" and is 
displayed to the right of Mini status.
This can occur via a status attack (the spell, the Dark Elf's Whisper and a 
few version specific weapons).
While under this status, the target is unable to use a fair number of 
commands, but allows the last command for a character 
to be executed.
Spells other than Piggy and special attacks cannot be used.


Note: Any characters afflicted by Piggy, Frog, or Mini can cast Esuna outside 
of battle.

Silence

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Echo Herb
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: A character afflicted by this is crouched down with an orangy 
message bubble hovering over them.
In the status menu, it is represented by an orangy message bubble and is 
displayed to the right of Mini status.
Description: When set, the target is unable to cast any Black, White, Summon, 
Twin, and Ninja Spell (I wonder if it checks 
against specific spells in the list...)
This can occur via a status attack (Slap or Mute spell).
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Enemies are not prevented from using special attacks under this status.


Blind/Darkness

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Eyedrop, Esuna

reduced by 1/2.
This can occur via a status attack (Darkness arrows or the Moth's Blind

This status continues to stick whether or not the character has Death or 
Stone status.
Strangely enough, the Aim and Peep commands ignore this status's negative 
effects.

Poison

Permanent: Yes
Reversable: Yes. Antidote, Esuna
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: A character afflicted by this is crouched down with a purpleish 
color over the character's face.
In the status menu, it is represented by "a bottle of poison" and is 
displayed to the right of Blind status.
When walking, the screen blurs a bit (using the mosaic effect).
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. A high Vitality/Stamina stat or a high max HP (for monsters only) 
slows down the timer to deal poison damage. 
Slow also slows down the timer. When the timer has elapsed, poison damage is 
dealt to the target. The timer can be reset 
by the spell Venom/Poison.
Description:  When set, the target will lose 1/8 of their HP in battle when 
the timer for this status has elapsed with 
minimum damage dealt is 1.
This can occur via a status attack (Poison arrows or the spell version).
Outside of battle, the character will lose 1 HP on every step until healed.
The target cannot die outside of battle due to poison (the character will be 
stuck at 1HP).

Note: Casting Exit while someone is under this status will at most lose 42HP. 
This is only applicable in the SNES version.

Curse

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Cross, Esuna
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: A floating "skull" hovers over the crouching character.
Hidden:  No
Timer: No
Description: When set, the target's attack power and defense is reduced by 
1/2.
This can occur via a status attack (Curse, a special attack of the same name, 
ironically, or the Ancient Sword).

Float

Permanent: Yes (only in town or dungeon) / No (overworld)
Reversable: Yes. Black Hole (the enemy spell only)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: Characters will be visually floating in air.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This status prevents damage tiles from hurting the characters.
This spell negates the Quake spell (including the enemy variation) from 
working.
This status visually masks critical status in the SNES version although you 
can tell when there are no attack/spell 
animations being used after giving the character a command.
This status is automatically removed after a battle on the overworld.
In a dungeon/town, it is automatically removed when entering/exiting 
buildings or stairs.
This status can be inflicted by the spell of the same name. It can be 
inflicted while a target is dead or petrified while 
outside of battle in the SNES version.

Note: Casting Exit while someone is not under this status and on a damage 
tile will at most will lose 2100HP. This is 
only applicable in the SNES version.

Paralysis

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Unicorn Horn
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: Character crouches with rings seemingly bind the character.
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. A high Will Power/Spirit or high Magic stat (for monsters only) 
reduces the duration of this status. Once 
the timer ends, the target is released from this status. This status's timer 
can be reset, but only from the Mage/Mind Flayer 
summon.
Description: See the following note...
This status can be inflicted by status attacks (Hold spell or any Whip).
Don't confuse this with the "metallic" status that the Magnetic Cave inflicts.

Sleep

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Unicorn Horn, Alarm
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: A blue sleep bubble looks like it is coming out of the crouching 
character's mouth.
Description: See the following note...
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. A high Will Power/Spirit or high Magic stat (for monsters only) 
reduces the duration of this status. 
Once the timer ends, the target is released from this status. This status's 
timer cannot be reset.
This can be inflicted by a status attack (Sleep spell and Cat Claw).

Paralysis and Sleep share the same properties:
When set, the character's ATB bar is frozen. A timer for this status is set.
This status is reversed when the timer for this status ends or the status is 
healed.
Once the status is reversed, the ATB bar is restarted.
The timer's duration is reduced when the target's Will Power/Spirit or Magic 
stat (for the monster) is high.

Charm

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Esuna, Unicorn Horn, Physical Attacks
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: A yellowish circle hovers over the character's head and the 
character moves over to "the other side".
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: The target loses complete control of their normal behavior.
A character under this status will attack a random character or attempts to 
cast a spell that they have available when 
their ATB bar is full.
The spell cast is only limited to Black or White magic and will be single 
targeted unless the spell is multitargeted by default.
If the command was issued while under this status, and the status is reversed 
before the command is executed,
the character will continue to execute the command.
All magic spells issued under this status completely ignore normal casting 
time (in other words, casting Meteor can be 
virtually instant).
A monster under this status will use a Charm specific battle script when 
thenr ATB bar is full.
Note that this script does not prevent the monster to target the character 
with physical or magic attacks (see Tinymages 
and Yellow Dragons).
If an attack command was issued while under this status, and this status is 
reversed before the command is executed,
the monster will continue to execute the command.
This is inflicted via a status attack (Charm spell or Breath).

Berserk

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Dispel, Unicorn Horn, Esuna (in FF4A)
Ignores Priority: No
Visual Cue: The character is uncontrollable (you'll never see their command 
menu).
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: A target under this status will always issue an attack command 
when the ATB bar is filled.
The ATB bar is reset when the status is inflicted.
The attack power of the target increases by 50%.
This is inflicted by a status attack (Berserk spell, Power Staff, Pinkpuff's 
Dance).

Note: The Avenger Sword is a special case weapon that is handled differently 
depending on the version of the game.

"Gradual Petrification" is dealt differently in the GBA port than it is in 
the SNES port. The statuses will be described 
separately.

Petrify (2/3 Stone) - SNES version

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Golden Needle, Esuna
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character's sprite is primarily in a stone-color.
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. A high Vitality/Stamina stat or high Max HP (for monsters only) 
slows down the timer's progression. Slow also 
slows down the timer. Once the timer has elapsed, Stone status is set. The 
timer cannot reset as it automatically advances 
to Stone status immediately.
Description: A timer is started for a transition into Stone status.
This status can occur via a status attack (Medusa Sword), another partial 
petrification attack (Black Lizard's Stone Gaze),
or the timer for transitioning from Stiff to Petrify status has completed.

Stiff (1/3 Stone) - SNES version

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Golden Needle, Esuna
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The clothing/area around character's legs are primarily in stone 
color.
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. A high Vitality/Stamina stat or high Max HP (for monsters only) 
slows down the timer's progression. Slow also 
slows down the timer. Once the timer has elapsed, Petrify status is set. The 
timer cannot reset as it automatically advances 
to Petrify status immediately.
Description: A timer is started for a transition into Petrify status.
This status can occur via a status attack (Black Lizard's Stone Gaze).

Gradual Petrification (2/3 Stone) - GBA version

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Golden Needle, Esuna
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: It looks like paralysis, except with grey/silver rings.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. A high Vitality/Stamina stat or high Max HP (for monsters only) 
slows down the timer's progression. Slow also 
slows down the timer. Once the timer has elapsed, Stone status is set. The 
timer cannot reset as it can only be advanced, 
although the transition to the next status is not guarenteed to occur on 
another Gradual Petrification attack.
Description: A timer is started for transition into Stone status.
This status can occur via a status attack (Gorgon Sword), another partial 
petrification attack (Black Lizard's Stone Gaze),
or the timer for transitioning from 1/3 Stone to 2/3 Stone status has 
completed.

Gradual Petrification (1/3 Stone) - GBA version

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Golden Needle, Esuna
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: It looks like paralysis, except with grey/silver rings.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. A high Vitality/Stamina stat or high Max HP (for monsters only) 
slows down the timer's progression. Slow 
also slows down the timer. Once the timer has elapsed, 2/3 Stone status is 
set. The timer cannot reset as it only be 
advanced, although the transition to the next status is not guarenteed to 
occur on another Gradual Petrification attack.
Description: A timer is started for transition into 2/3 Stone status. Once 
the time has elapsed, 2/3 Stone status is set.
This status can occur via a status attack (Black Lizard's Stone Gaze).
A partial petrification attack appears to advance the timer, but doesn't 
guarentee the next status to occur.

Note: This isn't confirmed, but it appears that Vitality appears to reduce 
the rate of petrification.

Metallic Paralysis

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (duh, don't equip metallic equipment)/No (you can't fix this 
status in battle)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: It looks pretty much like Paralysis.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: No
Description: If you equip any sort of metallic equipment in the Dark Elf's 
Cave (before he is defeated), you will be 
inflicted with this status in battle.
This metallic check either occurs in the menus or before battle.
In battle, you can inflict yourself with the status by equipping a metallic 
weapon/shield and execute a command.
This status is part of the "party death check/counter", but doesn't have the 
same properties as Death and Stone.
Characters under this status have their ATB bar frozen, but are still able to 
take all physical and magical attacks.

Stop

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes, but only while under Count/Doom. Dispel
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character is unable to take any commands while under this 
status.
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. The timer can be accelerated via Haste or decelerated via Slow. 
When the timer ends, the character is released 
from this status. This status's timer can be altered by the Stop spell or the 
different Hourglass items. The timer is set 
to the value of the spell or item.
Description: When set, the target's ATB bar stops as long as the timer set 
for this status.
This can be inflicted by a status attack (Stop spell or any Hourglass item).
The Hourglass item has longer durations set than the spell.

Statuses with timers affected include Paralysis, Sleep, Gradual 
Petrification, Regen, HP Leak, Count/Doom, Poison, Reflect/Wall

Note: This status is relatively buggy in the SNES version, when used in 
conjunction with Gradual Petrification, Sleep, 
Paralysis, and HP leak (on characters).

Egg

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (when physical or magical damage is dealt).
Ignores Priority: Yes (I guess, it is a starting status for enemies)
Visual Cue: The monster uses the Egg image.
Hidden: Unknown (this is an enemy specific status)
Timer: No
Description: Some monster formations start with this status, which is defined 
by their group data.
While under this status, the monster will not run any of its battle script.
Supposedly they can run a special battle script like Charm status does, but 
most enemies don't have anything so the 
Eggs do essentially nothing.
Monsters will use their magic counter script if a non-damaging magic attack 
is made.
When physical or magical damage is dealt, the monster in the egg "hatches" 
and removes Egg status.
The monster then runs its normal battle script.
Monsters berserked while under this status will attack you, and also never 
hatch themselves.

Parry/Defend

Permanent:  No
Reversable: Yes (when the character's turn comes up, this status ends)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character is in the command executed motion.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: No
Description: When you choose the command to defend, this status is used.
While under this status, the defense of the character increases by a factor 
of 2.
The status ends when the character's turn comes back up.

Charging

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (when the command is actually executed)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character uses the special command motion.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. High Agility reduces the duration of this timer. A powered up 
attack is the result of the timer ending 
normally. It is impossible to reset this status.
Description: When you choose the command Build Up/Power/Deadly, this status 
is used.
While under this status, the magic multiplier of the character drops to 0.
The status ends when the character makes the powered up attack.

Twin

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (when the spell to be cast is determined)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The characters involved in this status are casting simultaneously.
Hidden: Yes
Timer:  High Agility reduces the duration of this timer. A "dual cast" spell 
is the result of the timer ending. It 
is impossible to reset this status.
Description: This status is set when the Twin command is invoked.
Regardless of the success or failure of this spell, the status automatically 
ends.
This status can be removed when Stop, Silence, Stone, Death, Sleep, 
Paralysis, Berserk is inflicted on any character 
involved with the Twin command.

Jump

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (when the command is completed)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character jumps into the air and eventually lands on the 
monster.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. High Agility reduces the duration of this timer. A powered up 
attack is the result of the timer ending normally. 
It is impossible to reset this status.
Description: This status is set when the Jump command is executed.
All physical attacks on this target are redirected.
All single targeted magical attacks on this target are ignored/missed.
All multitargeted magical attacks subtract targets with this status in the 
magic damage algo.
Any status effect that has a timer is temporarily stopped.
Once the character lands on the target, the status is removed.
Any status effect that has a timer continues to run afterwards.

Count/Doom

Permanent: No
Reversable: No
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character is crouching when a command is not made with the 
death counter hovering over them.
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. This timer can only be paused by Stop. Once the timer elapses, 
Death status is inflicted. The timer can be 
reset by Count/Doom.
Description: When set, a timer is placed above the character's head denoting 
the amount of "ATB time" passes before Death 
status is set.
This timer only pauses to Stop status.
Haste/Slow/Agility does not affect this timer.

Hide

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (use Show command)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: Character "leaves" the battle.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: No
Description: When executing the Hide command, the status is set.
All other timers are stopped for the duration of this status.
The ATB bar proceeds as normal to take only 3 commands (Row/Defend/Show).
All physical attacks targeting this character are retargeted.
All single targeted magic will automatically fail on the character.
All multitargeted magic will subtract this target from the split damage 
factor.
This status ends when the Show command is executed.

Note: If the only target left is the hidden character, the target will be 
immediately attacked after they come out of 
hiding (assuming the monster ATB are full and that's not a guarentee for 
slower monsters), since the ATB is not stopped 
while the character is hidden.

HP Leak

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Dispel (strangely enough)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: HP continues to drop without outside influences.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. Haste reduces the duration of this status and Slow increases the 
duration. When the timer has elapsed, 
this status is removed. This status can be reset by another HP leak attack 
such as Bio.
Description: This status is inflicted with a spell that inflicts such status 
(Bio, Holy).
For Holy's HP leak to occur, the target must be weak vs the elemental for it 
to succeed.
In other words, the status is inflicted if the target is weak vs the 
elemental.
The timer is set to 60 by design (probably could be changed/hack) and loses 
as many HP as there are ATB timer "ticks".

Reflect/Wall

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Black Hole, Dispel
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: Reflectable magic bounce off a "magical wall".
Hidden: No
Timer: Yes. This timer can be stopped via Stopped and be accelerated by 
Haste. When the timer ends, this status is 
removed. This status can be reset by a reflected Wall spell (see Evil/Wicked 
Mask).
Description: This status is set by magic (Reflect) or item (Lunar/Light 
Curtain).
When set, all reflectable magic  set on a target bounce off this "wall" and 
target the opposing group.
A timer is set when this status is set, and when the timer ends the status is 
removed.
Monsters don't use elemental magic counter scripts with reflected spells 
(reflected Holy on Behemoths will invoke a 
physical attack instead of Storm).

Note: It is known that Dispel is reflectable, however it may have been a 
mistake. Go figure.

Barrier

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Dispel, Black Hole
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: All physical attacks automatically miss.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This status is set by the Lunar Curtain item.
There are some shared properties with Image...

Image (2)

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Dispel, Black Hole
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: Two transparant images are displayed to the right of the 
character.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This status is set with spells (Image, Blink) and item 
(Decoy/Scape Doll).
After a physical attack fails, Image (1) is set. If Barrier status was set 
previously, the Image (2) status does not change.

Image (1)

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes. Dispel, Black Hole
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: One transparent image is displayed to the right of the character.
Hidden: No
Timer: No
Description: This status is set with a spell (FF4's Mist Ring+Dragon) and 
after "an image is hit".
After a physical attack fails, this status is removed. If Barrier status was 
set previously, Image (1) status does not change.

Barrier, Image (2), Image (1) share the same property:
All physical attacks on the target with this status will automatically miss.

Covered

Permanent: No.
Reversable: Yes. (The Off command removes this status).
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character with the Cover command takes all physical damage 
from "Covered" target.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: No
Description: When the Cover command is executed, this status is set on the 
targeted character.
If the target is a monster or himself, this status does nothing.
This status is removed when the "Off" command is executed.

Critical

Permanent: No
Reversable: Yes (increase the current HP of the character over 1/4 their max 
HP)
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: The character crouches when animation that hovers over them, 
showing that they are really really hurt.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: No
Description: This status is automatically set when the current HP of the 
character is less than 1/4 their max HP.
This status is automatically removed when the current HP of the character is 
greater than 1/4 their max HP.

Cover and Critical status share the same properties:
The character with the Cover command automatically defends all physical 
attacsk for the character with this status.
Parry/Defend status on the character with Cover prevents this status from 
having any impact.
If the character with the Cover command is indisposed (Death, Stone, Break, 
Stop, Paralysis, Sleep),
that character cannot cover targets.

Regen

Permanent: No
Reversable: No
Ignores Priority: Yes
Visual Cue: Healing hits every character at the same time at set intervals.
Hidden: Yes
Timer: Yes. The number of intervals of healing decreases with greater 
Agility. When the timer ends, the status is 
removed. The timer can be reset when the Regen/Spirit Wave command is 
executed again (it is officially doable in FF4A, 
a hack is already available for changing this behavior on the SNES versions).
Description: This status is set when the Regen/Spirit Wave command is 
executed.
A timer is started when this status is applied.
All characters are healed by 10 points (that can be hacked/changed) over set 
intervals.
