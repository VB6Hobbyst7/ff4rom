-deathlike2

Search(Spell #144) "fixes" the targeting mechanism for the monster for their next turn... and it seems 
to have priority over the default targeting... whether it is the random targeting from a normal 
attack or a multitargeted attack.

For instance, Last Arm uses Fission when it is critical. This attack by default is a 
multitargeted sacrifice attack that damages everyone equally. If it used following Search, 
then the character targeted by Search gets hit instead.

Note that this behavior is occuring in the SNES version.. but not the GBA version... 
it should be looked into when multiple enemies are involved in the SNES version. 
There isn't any formation that does this, thus needing more testing.

Retarget if target is removed/dies?

In FF4A, the spell isn't retargeted...

In FF4, the spell is retargeted.

-Drain/Osmose seem to ignore the elemental attribute of the spell when dealing damage

Spell 175 (0xAF ) - Used by EvilWall to advance.

Spell 176 (0xB0) - Used by the Shadow Dragon to summon the "Mist Dragon".. to simulate Rydia summoning it behind the scenes.

Spell 188 (0xBC) - The damage data is gotten here. Note that the targeting is all allies because it 
would correctly reflect the damage. This is custom damage data for the spell.
