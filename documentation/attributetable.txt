Attribute Table
---------------
An attribute table is a set of flags, each of which correspond to one of the game's attributes.

An attribute is a flag corresponding to one of the game's elements and/or status effects.
FF4 treats elements, statuses, and even certain other properties as the same kind of thing.
Thus, you will see Fire in the same list as, say, Mute, or even things like "absorb".

There is a list of attribute tables that are commonly used for spells and items. These reference an index in the list rather than fully specifying a set of attributes for each item.
However, other objects such as monsters do not use this list and instead fully specify their own full set of attribute settings independently.
