Statuses that deactivate battle commands: 9FF19 to 9FF4F (FF2us ROM with header), with 2 bytes per command.

The first byte deals with status byte 03 (Swoon, Stone, Toad, Mini, Pig, Mute, Blind, Poison) and the second byte 
deals with status byte 04 (Curse, Float, etc.). For example, Kick's entry is 3840. In binary, 38 is 00111000, 
which correspond to Toad, Mini, and Pig. The value 40 is why Kick is disabled by Float. The data is for all 
the commands up until Change (and half of Parry).
