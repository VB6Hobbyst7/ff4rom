Other Noter: This Document is made to Comply and Compliment the Rom image and any Posible Editting programs that seem to be missing
             that certain bit or data for Items and Window Menus.
             Names Listed are those that I've incountered accordingly and chronologically.
             The "wy" was sir named for for upside down "my"(m to w) meaning my concurrent creation pertaining to the Snes system and 
                 not the "Wii" system.  More like "Why" am I ding this when I could just build my own version. (because retro/reverse
                 engineering takes a lot of patience and build character of understanding program processes).
             My lack of ASM explainations are to be forgiven and accepted as fact to give addresses and more info on the specifics of
                 that value in the address.  I can read and adapt to ASM coding from other sources, in which is where I found some of
                 the values needed in certain difficult address areas.

This Document Primarily Based off:
  FF2us  - FFII(us)  - SNES US Version of FF4 version 1.1
                         basically somewhat based off the FFIV(ET) as describe SoE(NA), but not the original Japan version.
                                                                                                                             
Posible to Moderate similarities:
  FF4ET  - FFIV(ET)  - Easytype version of FF4, do not suggest it is FF2 in Japanese, because that is completely untrue
                        
                                                                                                                             
Slight similarities:
  FF4    - FFIV      - Original Jap version
  FF4WSC - FFIV(WSC) - Wonderswan port of FF4, before and around the time of FF Anthology
  FF4PSX - FFIV(PSX) - The port is part of the FF Anthology Collection
  FF4A   - FFIVA     - GBA port of FF4, 
                       " US and Euro versions primarily covered which should match up with Jap 1.0 and 1.1 revisions respectively
  FF4DS  - FFIV(DS)  - Nintendo DS port of FF4
                       " based off the FFIVA version, but like FFIIIA styles.

        As I progressed further into finding the numbers needed,

Viewing Frame looks at the whole and divides by a base number, rather like using multiple sets of numbers.
  it also looks at the whole with added spaces to handle the upper underlapped lines that compliment the main line.
  and loops back to the first next player commands in order.
                                                                                                                                      
Example:
       v   vv   vv   vv   vv   vv   vv   vv   vv   vv   v
       -----Fight-----DWave-----Throw-----Heal -----Items  10dec x 5dec = 50dec(32hex)
       -----Fight-----White-----Black-----Summo-----Items
       -----Fight-----White-----Black-----Rcall-----Items
       ^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^^   ^
                                                                                                                                      
So by expanding just the printed area:

       -----Fight-----DWave-----Throw-----Heal -----Items-----Fight-----White
       -----Black-----Summo-----Items-----Fight-----White-----Black-----Rcall-----Items

So far I reduced the mysticism of mystery numbers to two fields:
   1) Print Area effected, How it's being printed, pointers and references to this and that area/line formats.
   2) Actual Printed Data, What is being printed, starting and stopping points.
                                                                                                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Known Facts about pointer references I found out for future references:
                                                                                                                                      
      For Field,Main,Battle Menus and Windows:
        29, 89, C9, E9 = unknown
        69 = primary vertical placement.
        A9 = primary horizontal placement. for most number place holders.
        A9 ##                                               = Other cases: Given Length for next number.
        A9 ##                                               = Most Cases: Generate every next number.
        BF ## ##                                            = Given Pointer for text address.
       (0F 99 FD 74 C8 E8 C0 ## 00 D0 F2 99 FD 74 4C A0 BC  = Given Length for next #. Battle popup window items/spells used/casted.)
        0F 99 FD 74 C8 E8 C0 ## 00 D0 F2 99 FD 74 4C A0 BC  = Generate every next #. Battle popup window items/spells used/casted.
        0F 99 74 07 C8 E8 C6 ## D0 F3 A4 40 A9 C8 99 7D 07  = ?? Event Give Item?
        0F C9 FF F0 0B 99 74 C8 84 3D E8 C6 07 D0 ED 4C 88  = ?? Treasure Get Item?
                                                                                                                                      
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        ?????                       etc controls the the base layout of original commands.
        11EDE, 11EE8,               etc controls the over layout of printed commands.
        B8054, B805A, B8060, B8066, etc controls the border and print layout of commands.
        Base commands are 5 chr spaces long on extra(top) row and 5 chr letters main row.
        code could look like:  FF FF FF FF FF 47 64 62 63 6F  for "Fight" command,
                     or like:  FF 47 FF 64 FF 62 FF 63 FF 6F,  or  47 FF 64 FF 62 FF 63 FF 6F FF.

                                       Is the handedness a ranged set (00-37=one hand, 38-3A=2 handed, etc)??
                                        What about equipable, selectable, castable, sellable, battle/field use??
                                          (equipable is canbe equiped, single hand, dual hand, 2-handed)
                                   Shadow Shield is one hand, other hand, equipable, sellable. 
                                          Can equipe on Bare/No-Handed, Left/Right hand, and NOT on Both(should be).

              All Above is correct and found true.
            Weapon Types:
              00-FF = denotes who equipes type of weapons.
            Armor Types:
              +00~3F = equip to Shield [Left/Right Hand(s)]
              +40~7F = equip to Head
              +80~BF = equip to Body
              +C0~FF = equip to Glove
                                                                                 
              True Except for Bows(82) and Arrows(42)
                                                                                  
              However; I tried making a Dark type sword mimicking the 
                Shadowy Sword (16): 793B0 - 80 23 50 00 04 00 15 00
              in spot/place for/of
                Spare Harp/Axe(46): 79530 - C0 B4 80 00 05 FF 1C 00
              and the Shadowy Sword could only be held in inate/primary hand 
                 and no other weapon could be equiped even when Ambidextrious(Both) Handed.
              So how is the Item/Weapon/Shield/Helmet/Armor/Gloves/BattleUse/FieldUse
                 Selectable, Has Info reference, Sellable, Usable(Battle), Usable(Field), Consumable, Equipable, ??
                 also it seems equip both and 2 handed are in another byte section.
              Maybe I'm looking too hard in the right places.

             These are offsets into page 0F. To derive a ROM address from this, add the table entry (remembering to reverse the order of
              the bytes as usual) to hex 70000, plus hex 200 for the header. You then get the address of the level-up data for level 1
              going up to level 2. However, characters don't have level-up data stored for levels they have already equalled or surpassed
              when you get them; for example, Cecil as a Dark Knight lacks level-up data for levels 1-9 since he starts out at level 10 at
              the beginning of the game. In all cases the game multiplies the character's old level - 1 (IIRC) by 5 and adds it to this
              address to get the address of the 5 byte long data for that level-up: 
             byte 0:
             bit 7 (MSB) Str
             bit 6 Agi
             bit 5 Vit
             bit 4 Wis
             bit 3 WP
             bits 0-2
             000 +0
             001 +1
             010 +2
             011 +3
             100 +4
             101 +5
             110 +6
             111 -1
             byte 1: base HP increase
             byte 2:
             bits 0-4 base MP increase
             bits 5-7 are the highest bits of the XP requirement. bytes 3-4 are the rest of the XP requirement.

There are a number of weapon bits that I've been unable to document: $07A750
found on SlickProductions on 2008-02-04: 

Bit 1: Silence Staff, Whip, Chain Whip, Blitz Whip, Flame Whip, Dragon Whip, Dwarf Axe, Ogre Axe, Crystal Sword, Ninja Star, Dummy
Bit 2: HandAxe, Ogre Axe
Bit 3: Silver Hammer, Earth Hammer, Wooden Hammer
Bit 5: Lit Arrows

For reference, here are all the bits:

Bit 1: Unknown
Bit 2: Unknown
Bit 3: Unknown
Bit 4: Unknown
Bit 5: Unknown
Bit 6: Long Range
Bit 7: Throwable
Bit 8: Metallic

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bit 3 is consistant for being a Hammer... anti-Machine, but also 2 handed
Bit 5 is Lightning Arrows aren't special, other than being Lightning elemental+Anti-Mech
Bit 2 is confusing.. I've never used the HandAxe (I could probably hack that into a save and see if it did anything).. only thing that is common between the two is that they are one handed and I don't think the HandAxe is anti-Giant...
Bit 1 has nothing in common with any of the listed weapons

Anti-machine and two handed are handled separately from these bits. The only thing I can think of for bit 1 is maybe an increased chance or critical hits.

Those three ASL's and the subsequent ADC is the multiplying. ASL x 3 is the same as multiplying by 8, and adding itself seems to be the 9. That holds true in this case, since the item ID number is 1.

$01/902B 0A          ASL A                   A:0001 X:1440 Y:0044 D:0100 DB:7E S:02E5 P:envmxdIzcHC:0332 VC:013 00 FL:08

In case it wasn't clear, that's your multiplier. That only gives you 5 bytes to work with, it's probably not going to be easily expanded on here.
If you're wondering where this is in the actual file, it's at 0x901D (add 0x200 if you have a header). 
 
01/902B:	2060DE  	JSR $DE60      (this used to be the three ASL's)
01/902E:	EA      	NOP
01/902F:	EA      	NOP            (this was the ADC)

01/DE60:	E220    	SEP #$20
01/DE62:	8F024200	STA $004202    (store item index)
01/DE66:	A90A    	LDA #$0A       (our multiplier, this makes items 10 characters, 9 + icon)
01/DE68:	8F034200	STA $004203    (store the multiplier)
01/DE6C:	EA      	NOP
01/DE6D:	EA      	NOP
01/DE6E:	EA      	NOP
01/DE6F:	EA      	NOP
01/DE70:	C220    	REP #$20
01/DE6E:	AF164200	LDA $004216    (A now contains our current item index)
01/DE73:	60      	RTS

The location for the math routine is at 0xDE60 (add 0x200 if your file has a header). It was the only place within JSR range, though I had room for a JSL.

One thing to note, with this new system, the current location of the item names are no longer valid. They'll need to be moved elsewhere. Expanding is a possibility, just make sure you know where to put them. This won't do much for battles, although a thought occurs. You can do what we did with items, make 2 lists. A 13 letter list and a 16 letter list. The 13 letter list is used for places that obviously can't fit the 16 letter list. The only thing you'd need to do is know when a specific list can be used.

Also, this is untested, though I'm fairly confident that new routine is within range to be JSR'ed to.

Lastly, if you want to expand the names farther, just change the multiplier (LDA #$0A).

$01/9045 A9 08       LDA #$08                A:0004 X:000A Y:0046 D:0100 DB:7E S:02E7 P:envMxdIzcHC:0776 VC:013 00 FL:08
$01/9047 85 45       STA $45    [$00:0145]   A:0008 X:000A Y:0046 D:0100 DB:7E S:02E7 P:envMxdIzcHC:0792 VC:013 00 FL:08

That LDA needs to be changed to 1 less than what your new multiplier is. That value is when the game knows to stop drawing letters.
