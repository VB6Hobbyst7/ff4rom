# Like the Cure subroutine does a check for Cure4, I confirmed that the Life subroutine does a check for Life2, 
which is why it does a complete HP restore. The Life subroutine also checks for a few other monster spells 
(AB Recover and AC Remedy) and does a full HP restore for them, too.

# I also confirmed that the generic spell subroutine does a check for summon spells, and if one is being casted it 
checks if the targets are allies (Asura skips this check). So, I was right that there is an ally safeguard for 
these spells. Why? I don't know, since you're not allowed to target them on allies anyway, and they're not 
reflectable. Anyway, to change this behavior and skip the check, change the value at 1D37D (ROM with header) from 
[10 AE] to [80 00]. You can then target allies with summons if you change the targeting byte within the spell.

# I found the code that specifies the spell multiplier (which we knew to be [wisdom/will] / 4 + 1). 
Within this block of code is a section that says if the spell has the status-spell bit set in the effect 
data, then this multiplier is set to 1. So far, this bit doesn't seem to have any other uses besides this.

# Deathlike2, I think you'll be particularly interested in this. I think I found the algorithm that 
calculates the spell hit rate. It uses the base hit rate of the spell and the modified wisdom/will 
of the character (modified meaning after equipment bonuses). The modified hit rate is the spell's base 
hit rate + (modified wisdom/will)/2. Furthermore, if the caster is blind, this modified hit rate is cut 
in half. Also, it appears to do a check to see whether the caster is in the first slot (character or enemy), 
and gives a 25% bonus to the hit rate if so:

modified hit rate = (spell's base hit rate) + (modified wisdom/will)/2
divide by 2 if Blind
multiply by 5/4 if in slot 1


* Magic Defense % gets cut in half if blind. It also gets the 5/4 bonus if the target is in slot 1 
(enemy or ally). So I guess this negates the Magic Hit Rate % bonus, and makes an enemy stronger 
against the rest of your party.
 * If the status bit is set on the spell, the Magic Defense Multiplier is set to 1.
 * If the target is a Toad or charging (from Yang's Power command), the Magic Defense Multiplier is set to 0.
 * If the target is an enemy and its Magic Defense Base is 255 (0xFF), then its Magic Defense % and 
 Magic Defense Multiplier are both set to 99.
    
 * Protect adds 5 to the physical defense base of the character, up to a max of 255.
 * Shell adds 3 to the magical defense base. I'm not sure why it's less, other than mag. def. stats are always 
 less than physical def. stats for the characters.
 * Here's what's interesting: neither of these will work in the battle with Zeromus. There's a check 
 that skips the subroutine if you're fighting Zeromus, making the battle that much more difficult. 

 * Dispel removes all the statuses we thought (Berserk, Image, Wall, Barrier) but also removes HP Leak. 
 * Effect 2A removes Berserk, Float, Image, Wall, Barrier, and resets the speed modifier. 
 That means this effectively removes Slow/Fast, and only positive statuses.

In the damage subroutines, the damage value is two bytes. The most significant bit of these bytes 
determines whether the damage is normal (0) or recovery (1). The second most significant bit determines 
whether the damage is HP (0) or MP (1).
